Search for axion-like particles in the Perseus galaxy cluster with MAGIC

This gitHub page is devoted to the article "Search for axion-like particles in the Perseus galaxy cluster with MAGIC".

In this paper, we search for axion-like particle (ALP) signatures in the spectral energy distribution (SED) of NGC1275 in the centre of the Perseus galaxy cluster and neighbouring IC310 using the MAGIC data.
In case axion-like particles exist, propagation of the very-high-energy gamma rays through astronomical distances and environments can be hindered with photon-ALP oscillations due to the strong external magnetic field. 
Considering magnetic fields of the environments in the line of sight, and obtaining the equations of motion, we plan to calculate the so-called photon survival probability. 
Photon-survival probability is the probability that once emitted photons of either polarization will survive the propagation and be detected as such. 
For this purpose, we will be using the Gammapy, open-source package for gamma-ray astronomy, and GammaALPs, used for the ALPs analysis and calculation of photon survival probability. 
Statistical analysis will be performed with Gammapy using two different approaches, binned and unbinned analysis, with the aim to compare their performance in the case of ALPs studies. 
Our goal is to use the NGC1275 containing one flaring state, post-flaring and low activity state and IC310 data of one flaring state to test the values of ALPs mass and their coupling to photons, and ultimately constrain the ALPs parameter space.
