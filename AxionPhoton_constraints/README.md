This folder contains the constraints on the ALPs parameter space that were obtained with in the article 
"Constraints on axion-like particles with the Perseus Galaxy Cluster with MAGIC". 
95%_CL.txt and 99%_CL.txt respectively, contain the contour lines in the ALPs parameter space corresponding to the 95% and 99% confidence level, respectively.
For the remaining constraints previously set with other experiments, we advise the reader to consider the repository https://cajohare.github.io/AxionLimits/, from where they can be exctracted and plotted together with the constraints from this work.
